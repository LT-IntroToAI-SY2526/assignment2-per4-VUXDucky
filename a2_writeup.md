# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult for me when I was completing the function for % because I went into the mind set of it being similar to _ which it was but figuring out how to add the ["x y"] and etc took me awhile to figure out before I got the solution.



2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
How you could use the match function for extraction information from a movie databases is it matches the words that are already the same between the source and the pattern, but then the % and _ is where the program will extract from a database the movie and read the rest of the _ to find what its looking for.
